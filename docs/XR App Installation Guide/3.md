   If this menu is not shown, this means that you did not install Vuforia with Unity (Unity versions before 2019.2) or did not add the Vuforia Engine package to your project (Unity 2019.2 and later).

   - Start by adding an ARCamera. This is a Unity camera game object that includes the VuforiaBehaviour to add support for augmented reality apps for both handheld devices and digital eyewear.
